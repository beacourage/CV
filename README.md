## Beatrice Courage

I have recently completed Makers Academy: a 12 week bootcamp teaching the fundamentals of coding. 

I have completed a Master's degree in Astrophysics and Physical Chemistry at UCL, and since completing my degree, I have worked as a healthcare assistant in a forensic psychiatric hospital.  
After graduating, I hope to become a software developer, and I believe that I have the drive and sensitivity to make a success of it.  

## Skills

#### Good Communication Skills

Whilst working at the psychiatric hospital, I provided direct care to vulnerable and unpredictable patients. This has allowed me to develop strong communication skills.  I also volunteer at a Hospice, where I talk to patients and communicate with them regularly.  

#### Fast Learner and Problem Solver

I have always enjoyed learning and I relish in a fast paced learning environment. I believe that my degree in Astrophysics and Physical Chemistry reflects this. I received 85% in The Physics of the Stars, and 78% in Advanced Physical Chemistry, two advanced and complex modules at UCL, and received a Higher Education Achievement Award. I am highly numerical and achieved Silver Awards in three prestigious UK maths challenges.
