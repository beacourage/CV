# Beatrice Courage

I have recently completed Makers Academy: a 12 week bootcamp teaching the fundamentals of coding.  Prior to Maker's Academy, I worked in a Forensic Psychiatric Hospital and I have completed a Master's degree in Astrophysics and Physical Chemistry at UCL.
I hope to become a junior software engineer, and I believe that I have the drive and sensitivity to make a success of it.

## Skills

#### Good Communication Skills

Whilst working at the psychiatric hospital, I provided direct care to vulnerable and unpredictable patients. This has allowed me to develop strong communication skills.  I also volunteer at a Hospice, where I talk to patients and communicate with them regularly.  

#### Fast Learner and Problem Solver

I have always enjoyed learning and I relish in a fast paced learning environment. I believe that my degree in Astrophysics and Physical Chemistry reflects this. I received 85% in The Physics of the Stars, and 78% in Advanced Physical Chemistry, two advanced and complex modules at UCL, and received a Higher Education Achievement Award. I am highly numerical and achieved Silver Awards in three prestigious UK maths challenges.
