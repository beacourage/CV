## Beatrice Courage

I am about to start at Makers Academy, a 12 week bootcamp teaching the fundamentals of coding. I have completed a Master's degree in Astrophysics and Physical Chemistry at UCL, and since completing my degree, I have worked as a healthcare assistant in a forensic psychiatric hospital.  
After graduating, I hope to become a software developer, and I believe that I have the drive and sensitivity to make a success of it.
