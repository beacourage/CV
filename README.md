# Background

I have recently completed Makers Academy: a 12 week bootcamp teaching the fundamentals of coding.  Prior to Maker's Academy, I worked in a Forensic Psychiatric Hospital and I have completed a Master's degree in Astrophysics and Physical Chemistry at UCL.
I hope to become a junior software engineer, and I believe that I have the drive and sensitivity to make a success of it.

# Experience

#### Healthcare Assistant – Forensic Psychiatric Hospital  (Nov. 2017-Oct.2018)     
- Provided direct care to vulnerable and unpredictable patients.
- Conducted level one and level two observations, noting mental state, activity and behavior at regular intervals.
- Update patient care plans, write progress notes, supervise family visits, escort patients on ground leave.
- Worked with a multidisciplinary team in a varied and fast-paced environment.

- Volunteered weekly in the in-patient unit and the day centre


# Skills, personal interest, awards
- Fast Learner and Problem Solver:
    I have always enjoyed learning and I relish in a fast paced learning environment. I believe that my degree in Astrophysics and Physical Chemistry reflects this. I received 85% in The Physics of the Stars, and 78% in Advanced Physical Chemistry, two advanced and complex modules at UCL, and received a Higher Education Achievement Award. I am highly numerical and achieved Silver Awards in three prestigious UK maths challenges. Furthermore, the intensive nature of the Maker's experience ensures you graduate a fast learner.
- Very strong Communication Skills:
    I have always enjoyed working with others and learning from them, it speeds up my development and adds an element of fun that would not be there if I was always working in isolation. I definitely believe that two brains are more powerful then one, and there is always so much you can learn from another person regardless of their ability.  I believe that I am a very outgoing and positive person and I love forming connections and seeing the best in others.  Working with and talking to people is my number one passion and I was pleasantly surprised to find that coding is probably one of the most collaborative activities out there.

- Higher Education Achievement Award (HEAR) for most improved student.                                           
- Member of Royal Society of Chemistry’s outreach initiative: Spectroscopy in a Suitcase, SIAS.                        
- Good public speaker – Delivered presentations at UCL to students on ‘Single molecule magnets’ and ‘Binding affinities of drug-protein complexes.’
- Keen actress – Have appeared in many plays throughout both school and first year of UCL.                           
- Good musician – Associated board of music grade 8 in both singing and piano.
-	Strong leadership skills – Senior prefect and school council leader at St Marys.
